# How I Built an Okta Documentation Chatbot in Python

This repo is a .NET MAUI application that uses Okta for authentication. It uses Okta's redirect model to sign in and displays your profile information.

Please read How to Add Authentication to .NET MAUI Apps to see how it was created.

### Prerequisites:

Library installation: The script begins with installing the required Python packages: [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/), [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/installation.html), and [LlamaIndex](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index/). These packages work with the GPT-3.5 model, create the web interface, and manage the chatbot's conversation.

Get an OpenAI API key by creating an account and following the instructions at https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key. Replace the API Key code snippet with your API Key

Download the files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11W-cjmkTztmnGgJCsJRtE395Iji6JX53?usp=share_link and make sure the files are saved on your drive (not within any folders) and you are mounting the files from the correct account
